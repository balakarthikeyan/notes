# What is Symfony? 

Symfony is a PHP framework used to develop web application, APIs, microservices and web services

# Folder Structure:
- `bin`: Contains the executable files
- `config`: Contains all the configuration defined for any environment
- `public`: This is the document root. It holds all publicly accessible files, such as index.php, stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images. The index.php file is also called “front controller”.
- `src`: Contains all the Symfony-specific code (controllers and forms), your domain code (e.g., Doctrine classes) and all your business logic
- `templates`: Contains all the template files for the application
- `tests`: This houses the files for functional or unit test
- `translations`: Contains translation files for internationalization and localization
- `var`: Contains all the cache and log files generated by the application
- `vendor`: Contains all application dependencies installed by Composer

# Create project
```
symfony check:requirements
composer create-project symfony/website-skeleton:<version> <project-name>
composer create-project symfony/skeleton:"6.2.*" <project-name>
symfony new <project-name> --version="6.2.*"
```

# Few Bundles
```
composer require --dev maker
composer require --dev ormfixtures 
composer require --dev fakerphp/faker
composer require symfony/maker-bundle
composer require symfony/twig-bundle
composer require symfony/mailer
composer require symfony/google-mailer
composer require form validator
composer require security security-csrf annotations
composer require doctrine doctrine/annotations
composer require twig
composer require --dev symfony/test-pack
```

# Console commands
```
symfony console make:controller <controller-name>
symfony console make:crud <project-name>
symfony console make:user
symfony console make:auth
symfony console make:registration
```

# Doctrine commands
```
symfony console doctrine:database:create
symfony console make:entity <entity-name>
symfony console make:migration
symfony console doctrine:migrations:migrate
symfony console doctrine:schema:update --force
symfony console make:fixture <fixture-name>
symfony console doctrine:fixtures:load
symfony console doctrine:fixtures:load --purge-with-truncate
```

# Project based commands
```
symfony server:start --no-tls
php -S localhost:8000 -t public/
php bin/console doctrine:query:sql 'SELECT * FROM user'
php bin/console debug:router
php bin/console debug:autowiring
```

# Debugging
- `php bin/console debug:container`
This command will show you all the services already registered or auto wired. 

- `php bin/console debug:container log`
This will list all the services that do things with logging. 

```bash
php bin/console cache:warmup
php bin/console debug:container hello
```
The above commands warm up the cache and search for the hello service in the container.

# Bundles

- `symfony/maker-bundle:` This bundle helps you create empty commands, controllers, form classes, tests, and more so you can forget about writing boilerplate code.
- `symfony/security-bundle:` This bundle integrates the complete security system for our Symfony web application and provides ways to authorize authenticated users based on their roles.
- `symfony/flex:` This is a tool that makes adding new features seamless through the use of a simple command.

# Debugging  my project
```
composer dump-autoload
composer update --no-scripts
composer install --no-dev --no-interaction --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader
php bin/console cache:clear
php bin/console route:cache
php bin/console view:clear
php bin/console migrate --force
```
