MySQL is a popular open-source relational database system renowned for its efficiency in handling complex queries. It’s widely used for managing large volumes of data, and its capabilities are unparalleled. We can confidently manage even the most intricate data sets with the proper understanding.

## What are DDL, DML, and DCL?

These specific MySQL interview questions and answers for experienced candidates can be helpful. DDL stands for Data Definition Language in MySQL, and it is used in database schemas and descriptions to determine how data should be stored in the database.

DDL Queries:

- CREATE
- ALTER
- DROP
- TRUNCATE
- COMMENT
- RENAME

DML stands for Data Manipulation Language and is used to manipulate data in databases. It largely consists of standard SQL commands for storing, modifying, retrieving, deleting, and updating data.

DML Queries are:

- SELECT
- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE
- MERGE
- CALL
- EXPLAIN PLAN
- LOCK TABLE

DCL stands for Data Control Language and encompasses instructions that deal with user rights, permissions, and other database system controls.

List of queries for DCL:

- GRANT
- REVOKE

## What is subqueries? 

A subquery is a query nested within another query (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE). It operates as a tool to create more complex expressions within your main query.

## What is Join? 

A join is a way to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

- `Inner Join:` Returns only the matching rows from both tables.
- `Left Join (Outer Join):` Returns all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If there's no match, NULL values are returned for the right table.
- `Right Join (Outer Join):` Similar to a left join but returns all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table.
- `Full Outer Join:` Returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or right table, and NULL values where there's no match.
- `Self Join:` A self-join is a join in which a table is joined with itself. It can be helpful when you have hierarchical data or need to compare rows within the same table.

## What is Index? 

An index is a separate data structure stored alongside your table. It holds sorted copies of a specific column and pointers back to the corresponding rows in your main table.

Key Consideration
- `Columns frequently used in WHERE clauses:` These are prime candidates for indexing.
- `Columns used for sorting:` Indices can optimize ORDER BY operations.
- `Size of the index:` Large indices consume more space and can slightly impact insertion speed.
- `Number of indices per table:` Too many indices can slow down updates and inserts.

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_to_index); 
```

## What are the major Optimization Considerations?

### Use Explain statement:
The EXPLAIN statement provides insights into how MySQL plans to execute your query. It will reveal which indexes (if any) were used, how tables are joined, and the estimated cost of different steps.

### Use Temporary Tables:
Temporary tables can be valuable in your optimization toolbox but require strategic use. These tables are created on the fly to hold intermediate results, which can be helpful for breaking down complex queries into smaller and more manageable steps or storing pre-calculated results that are used multiple times in a query.

### Query Caching:
MySQL has a built-in query cache that stores the results of frequently used queries. This cache acts as a shortcut, allowing the database to retrieve results instantly from the cache instead of re-executing the entire query.

Query caching can significantly improve performance for repetitive queries, but it requires careful management as cached results might become outdated if the underlying data changes.

### Denormalization:
Denormalization is a technique for strategically introducing controlled redundancy in your database schema. Denormalization involves duplicating certain data points across multiple tables to avoid complex joins.

### Upgrading Hardware:
While optimizing your queries is essential, the underlying hardware also affects performance. Upgrading your database server’s RAM, storage, and CPU can significantly boost performance, especially for large datasets or complex queries.

## What is Database Replication?

Database replication is a technique used to create and maintain copies of a database in different locations or on different servers and keep them in sync in real-time. Its main purpose is to ensure data availability and improve fault tolerance. Replication involves copying, or mirroring, a database’s data to one or more destination databases, which can be situated on separate servers, often in different geographic locations. These copies can serve various purposes, such as load balancing, disaster recovery, or real-time data distribution.

## What Is Synchronous Replication?

Synchronous replication is a process of writing data to two systems at once. It allows for simultaneous updates of multiple repositories and is often used with a storage area network (SAN), local area network (LAN), wireless network, or other type of segmented system. 

- `Data Consistency:` Strong
- `Latency:` Higher

## What Is Asynchronous Replication?

Products that use asynchronous replication, copy data to the replica after the data is already written to the primary storage. This replication process typically occurs on a scheduled basis. For example, write operations may be transmitted to a replica in batches periodically.

- `Data Consistency:` Moderate
- `Latency:` Lower

## What Is Semi-Synchronous Replication?

Semi-synchronous replication is a compromise between synchronous and asynchronous replication. In this method, the source database waits for acknowledgment from at least one destination server before considering the transaction complete.

- `Data Consistency:` Balanced
- `Latency:` Moderate

## What is the timing of the replication?

- Synchronous replicates the data as it’s written to primary storage.
- Asynchronous replicates it afterward.

## What are the type of data storage?

- `Asynchronous replication` is more widely supported by array-based, network-based, and host-based replication products. 
- `Asynchronous replication`, is mainly used for data backups. 
- `Synchronous replication` typically uses higher-end, block-based storage arrays. 
- `Synchronous replication` is mainly used for high-end transactional applications that require instant failover if the primary node fails. 

## What are the requirements for setting up MySQL Replication?

- `MySQL Version:` Ensure that both the source and replica servers are running the same version of MySQL. This will guarantee that data can be replicated between the two servers without any compatibility issues.
- `Network Connectivity:` The source and replica servers need to be able to communicate with each other over a network. This can be achieved by having both servers on the same network, or by setting up a secure connection between them.
- `User Privileges:` A user account is required for replication, and it must have sufficient privileges on both the source and replica servers. The user must have the `REPLICATION SLAVE` privilege on the source and the `REPLICATION CLIENT` privilege on the replica.
- `Binary Logging:` Binary logging must be enabled on the source server. This is essential for the replica to receive updates to the database. In order to set up binary logging in MySQL replication, you need to modify the MySQL configuration file (my.cnf or my.ini) on the source server to enable binary logging.
- `Unique Server IDs:` Each MySQL server must have a unique server ID. This allows you to keep track of which data is being replicated from where.
- `Source Database Backup:` To initialize the replica, you need to create a backup of the source database. This can be done using the `mysqldump` utility.
- `Storage Space:` Make sure that both the source and replica servers have enough storage space to accommodate the replicated data.

## What is the difference between master-slave replication and master-master replication in MySQL?

`Master-Slave Replication:` In this configuration, there's one master server and one or more slave servers. The master server handles all the write operations, while the slave servers replicate the data from the master and handle read operations. The data flows in a unidirectional manner from the master to the slaves. This setup is commonly used to distribute read load, or for backup and analytics purposes.

`Master-Master Replication:` In this configuration, two or more servers act as masters, and the data is synchronized bidirectionally across the servers. Each server can handle both read and write operations, allowing updates on any of the masters. This setup provides redundancy, fault tolerance, and improved write performance. However, it can lead to increased complexity in managing potential conflicts and ensuring consistency between the masters.

## What is MySQL Triggers ?

In MySQL, a trigger is a stored program invoked automatically in response to an event such as insert, update, or delete that occurs in the associated table.

The SQL standard defines two types of triggers: row-level triggers and statement-level triggers.

A `row-level trigger` is activated for each row that is inserted, updated, or deleted.
A `statement-level trigger` is executed once for each transaction regardless of how many rows are inserted, updated, or deleted.

## What is MySQL Storage Engines ?

In MySQL, a storage engine is a software component responsible for managing how data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated within tables. A storage engine also determines the underlying structure and features of the tables.
 
## Describe BLOB in MySQL?

BLOB or Binary Large Object can be used to store binary data in MySQL. Sometimes binary data like images need to be stored in SQL databases.

There are four BLOB types including TINYBLOB, BLOB, MEDIUMBLOB and LONGBLOB can hold up to 255 bytes, 65,535 bytes, 16,777,215 bytes and 4,294,967,295 bytes respectively.

## How are VARCHAR and CHAR different?

Both `CHAR` and `VARCHAR` data types store characters up to specified length.

- `CHAR` stores characters of fixed length while `VARCHAR` can store characters of variable length.
Storage and retrieval of data is different in `CHAR` and `VARCHAR`.
- `CHAR` internally takes fixed space, and if stored character length is small, it is padded by trailing space characters. `VARCHAR` has 1 or 2 byte prefix along with stored characters.
- `CHAR` has slightly better performance.
- `CHAR` has memory allocation equivalent to the maximum size specified while `VARCHAR` has variable length memory allocation.

## What is self referencing foreign key?

A foreign key which is stored in a table itself is called to be self referencing foreign key.
```sql
CREATE TABLE `Employee`( 
`name` VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL, 
`employee_id` CHAR(9) NOT NULL, 
`manager_id` CHAR(9) NOT NULL, 
`salary` decimal(10,2) NULL,  
PRIMARY KEY(`employee_id`),
FOREIGN KEY (`manager_id`) REFERENCES employee(`employee_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## What is the difference between Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML)?

`Data definition language (DDL)` commands are the commands which are used to define the database. CREATE, ALTER, DROP and TRUNCATE are some common DDL commands.

`Data manipulation language (DML)` commands are commands which are used for manipulation or modification of data. INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE are some common DML commands.

## What is the difference between TRUNCATE and DELETE?

`DELETE` is a Data Manipulation Language(DML) command. It can be used for deleting some specified rows from a table. DELETE command can be used with WHERE clause.

`TRUNCATE` is a Data Definition Language(DDL) command. It deletes all the records of a particular table. TRUNCATE command is faster in comparison to DELETE. While DELETE command can be rolled back, TRUNCATE can not be rolled back in MySQL.

## Explain difference between TIMESTAMP and DATETIME?

Both `TIMESTAMP` and `DATETIME` store date time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format. 
While `DATETIME` stores provided date time, `TIMESTAMP` first converts provided time to UTC while storing and then again converts it back to server time zone upon retrieval. So if you need to serve different users in different countries using same time data, TIMESTAMP facilitates it. DATETIME simply stores provided date time without making any time zone related conversion.

## Explain GRANT command in MySQL?

When a new MySQL user is created, he requires certain privileges to perform various database operations. GRANT command grants certain privileges to the user.

`GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON customertable TO 'username'@'localhost'`

## Explain the use of FEDERATED tables in MySQL?

`FEDERATED` tables are tables through which MySQL provides a way to access database tables located in remote database servers. Actual physical data resides in remote machine but the table can be accessed like a local table. To use a federated table `ENGINE=FEDERATED` and a connection string containing user, remote hostname, port, schema and table name are provided in CREATE TABLE command.

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_fed (
 ... 
)
ENGINE=FEDERATED
CONNECTION='mysql://user@remote_hostname:port/federated_schema/table';
```

## How can ENUM be used in MySQL?

ENUM can be used to set a column as enum type. ENUM in MySQL is string object which can take one of the permitted value.
```sql
CREATE TABLE `Student`(
`rollnumber` INT NOT NULL, 
`name` VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL, 
`country` ENUM('USA', 'UK', 'Australia'), 
PRIMARY KEY(`rollnumber`));

INSERT INTO `Student` values('6', 'John', 'USA');
```
 
## What are different TEXT data types in MySQL. ## What is difference between TEXT and VARCHAR?

Different text data types in MySQL include: TINYTEXT, TEXT, MEDIUMTEXT and LONGTEXT.

These data types have different maximum size. 

`TINYTEXT` can hold string up to 255 characters, 
`TEXT` can hold up to 65,535 characters, 
`MEDIUMTEXT` can hold up to 16,777,215 characters and
`LONGTEXT` can hold up to 4,294,967,295 characters.

`VARCHAR` is also a variable text data type with some difference. 
`VARCHAR` is stored inline in the database table while `TEXT` data types are stored elsewhere in storage with its pointer stored in the table. A prefix length is must for creating index on TEXT data types. 
`TEXT` columns do not support default values unlike `VARCHAR`.
 
## What different stored objects are supported in MySQL?

Different stored objects in MySQL include VIEW, STORED PROCEDURE, STORED FUNCTION, TRIGGER, EVENT.

- `VIEW` - It is a virtual table based on a result set of a database query.
- `STORED PROCEDURE` - It is a procedure stored in database which can be called using CALL statement. Stored procedure does not return a value.
- `STORED FUNCTION` - It is like function calls which can contain logic. It returns a single value and can be called from another statement.
- `TRIGGER` - Trigger is program which is associated with a database table which can be invoked before or after insert, delete or update operations.
- `EVENT` - Event is used to run a program or set of commands at defined schedule.
 
## What is AUTO INCREMENT in MySQL?

`AUTO INCREMENT` in MySQL is used to automatically assign next unique integer value to a particular column.

`AUTO INCREMENT` can be used to generate unique id for each inserted row without assigning a value to it. In MySQL, only columns which keep unique values like column with `UNIQUE CONSTRAINT` or PRIMARY KEY can be marked for `AUTO INCREMENT`. A table can have only one column marked for `AUTO INCREMENT`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE `Student`(
`studentid` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
`rollnumber` INT NOT NULL, 
`name` VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL, 
`country` ENUM('USA', 'UK', 'Australia'), 
PRIMARY KEY(`studentid`));
```
 
## What is difference between BLOB and TEXT in MySQL?

- `BLOB` data types are designed to store binary data like picture or video in database.
- `TEXT` data types are designed to store large text data.
- `BLOB` stores binary byte string while TEXT stores character string. 
- `TEXT` data types support sorting and comparison around text which is not supported by BLOB.
 
## What is the use of DELIMETER command in MySQL?

`DELIMITER` command can be used to change delimiter in MySQL from ; to something else. It is used while writing trigger and stored procedures in MySQL. MySQL workbench or MySQL client use ; as delimiter to separate different statements. 
```sql
--- Command below make // as delimiter while writing a stored procedure.
DELIMITER //
--- afterward revert it back by calling below command.
DELIMITER ;
```
 
## Compare MySQL and PostgreSQL ?

MySQL is a RDBMS (relational database) while PostgreSQL is an ORDBMS (object relational database) which means apart from relational database, it also supports some object oriented language features like table inheritance and functional overloading.

- `MySQL` has better performance in case of simple queries. PostgreSQL has better support for complex queries.
- `PostgreSQL` is fully ACID compliant while MySQL is ACID compliant while using InnoDB. 
- `PostgreSQL` is better choice than mysql for highly reliable applications.
- `PostgreSQL` has better support to Json, XML and geometric types in comparison to MySQL.
- Both PostgreSQL and MySQL have some `NoSQL` support but PostgreSQL has better support to NoSQL. 
- `PostgreSQL` supports data types such as numeric, character, date and time, spatial, and JSON.
- `MySQL` supports enumerated, network addresses, arrays, ranges, XML, hstore, composite, and MySQL data types.
- `PostgreSQL` supports multiple indexes. MySQL supports B-tree and R-tree indexes.
 
## Example of UPSERT logic using MySQL?
Multiple column index works on left most prefix of the indexed columns. 

Use `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` to run a command which can do an `INSERT` and `UPDATE` if needed in a single statement.
```sql
INSERT INTO `User` (`userid`, `name`, `mobilenumber`) 
VALUES('11112227', 'Alice', '876876876') 
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE name='Alice', mobilenumber='876876876';
```
 
## What are differences between MyISAM and InnoDB database engines commonly used in MySQL?

Row level locking, foreign key support and transacation support are main features which differentiate InnoDB from MyISAM.

- `MyISAM` was default storage engine before 5.5 while InnoDB is default storage engine from 5.5 and later versions.
- `InnoDB` is ACID compliant ensuring data integrity while MyISAM is not ACID compliant.
- `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` are supported by `InnoDB`.
- `InnoDB` has row level locking, which makes it faster in highly concurrent cases.
- `MyISAM` which has locking at table level.
- Foreign key constraint is supported only in `InnoDB` and not `MyISAM`. 
- `InnoDB` is appropriate engine for payment related applications where transaction support becomes important.
 
## Comparison between MySQL and Oracle database?

- `MySQL` is open source and free. 
- `Oracle` provides express edition for free but it comes with limited features. Oracle provides enterprise level tools.
- `Oracle` is better in terms of scalability. Oracle is suited for large scale enterprise level projects.
- `MySQL` is suited for small and medium sized websites and read only websites.
- `MySQL` is Relational DBMS, Oracle has features of Object Relational DBMS. It supports more complex object relational model in additional to Relational DBMS supported by MySQL.
- `MySQL` uses mysqldump or mysqlhotcopy for data backup. 
- `Oracle` supports many options including Export and Import, Offline backup, Online backup, using RMAN utility, Export or Import Data Pump.
- `PL/SQL` is supported in Oracle while MySQL does not support PL/SQL.
- `MySQL` uses username, password and host for security. 
- `Oracle` database provides features like profile validation for security along with username, password.
 
## What does OPTIMIZE TABLE command do in MySQL?

A database table can be defragmented over the time. OPTIMIZE TABLE command can be executed to reorganize table data and index. OPTIMIZE TABLE command might be useful for tables which are frequently updated. It can help improve performance of I/O operations.
 
## What is database engine or storage engine?

Database engines or storage engines are software programs which perform database operations like create, read, update and delete. Major storage engines supported by MySQL are InnoDB and MyISAM.

- `InnoDB storage engine` - default MySQL storage engine from version 5.5 and later. InnoDB is ACID compliant, provides transaction support and foreign key support.
- `MyISAM storage engine` - default storage engine before 5.5. It is non-transactional.
- `MEMORY storage engine` - it creates temporary database tables in memory.
- `CSV storage engine` - it uses csv file for storing data.
- `FEDERATED storage engine` - helps access data physically located in remote database server using a query to local database server.
- `MERGE storage engine` - can be used to merge more than one table with identical column data into one table.
- `ARCHIVE storage engine` - uses zlib compression to store archived data using less space, does not support indexing.
- `BLACKHOLE storage engine` - acts like a black hole, accepts data to store, does not store it and always returns empty. It can be used in performance testing.
 
## What is autocommit in MySQL? 
In MySQL, if `autocommit` is `disabled`, any command you run will not be committed automatically, which means changes made through these commands will become permanent only if COMMIT is called. 

If by default `autocommit` is `enabled`, which means any change we make is part of a single transaction, commit is done automatically and it can not be rolled back.

If `autocommit` is enabled you can call `START TRANSACTION` to start a transaction. `START TRANSACTION` command makes the changes temporary until either `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` is called to end the transaction.

## What is MySQL Partition ?
Partitioning is used in database to split a table data into multiple parts called partitions and store them separately. It can further be classified into horizontal partitioning and vertical partitioning.

- `Horizontal partitioning` - rows which match a partitioning function are stored in corresponding partition.
- `Vertical partitioning` - Different columns of a table can be stored in different physical partitions using vertical partitioning.

## Which partitioning types does MySQL support?

- `Range partitioning` - rows are partitioned based on a certain range of column value.
- `List partitioning` - rows are partitioned based on if column value is same as value provided in a list.
- `Hash partitioning` - rows are partitioned based on hash of column value. It provides a more even partitioning. Hash is computed based on user defined hash function.
- `Key partitioning` - rows are partitioned based on a hashing function provided by MySQL like MD5 hash.

## How do you use partitioning in MySQL?

The `PARTITION BY` clause is used in Window functions to break the result set into partitions to which the window function is applied. This allows the calculation of a function for each row in the partition independently.

Each partition operates like a sub-table within the main table. There are two main things inside partitioning:

- `Partitioning Key:` The column or set of columns determines how the data is split into partitions.
- `Partition Expression:` The logic that defines how rows are distributed among partitions.

## How many tables can a trigger associate to in MySQL?

A trigger in MySQL can be associated to a permanent table. It can not be associated to more than one table. Also a trigger cannot be associated to temporary table or view.
  
## What is the use of SAVEPOINT in MySQL?

`SAVEPOINT` is like a bookmark while running statements in transaction mode. I helps rolling back to a specific location in the transaction. Below command can be used to create a save point while running MySQL in transaction mode.

`SAVEPOINT savepointName;`
And current transaction can be rolled back to desired saved save point location by running below command.

`ROLLBACK TO savepointName;`
Unlike ROLLBACK or COMMIT commands which end currently running transaction, ROLLBACK TO savepointName does not end current transaction.

## What are the most common functions in MySQL Server?

The most used functions in MySQL servers are String functions, Numeric functions, Date and time functions, Aggregate functions, and Other functions. 

- `String functions` consist of `CONCAT(), LEFT(), RIGHT() & SUBSTRING() LEN(), LTRIM(), RTRIM() & TRIM(), REPLACE(), LOWER() and UPPER()`.
- `Numeric functions` contain `ABS(), and ROUND()`. 
- `Data and time functions` consist of `DATEDIFF(), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), DATEADD(), DAY(), MONTH(), YEAR()`. 
- `Aggregate functions` consist of `COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX()`. 
- `Other functions` consist of `CAST() & CONVERT(), COALESCE(), ISNULL(), and NULLIF()`.

## What do ROLLUP, GROUPING SETS, and CUBE Do in T-SQL?​

These functions are expansions of GROUP BY: 

- `ROLLUP`: It lets you make multiple grouping sets, adding subtotals and grand totals.  
- `GROUPING SETS`: It lets you specify multiple grouping sets, similar to combining multiple GROUP BY clauses, but in a single query.  
- `CUBE`: It creates groups for all possible combinations of columns and includes subtotals. 

## Explain the lock in the MySQL server?

Locks are important to maintain transaction concurrency. Whenever multiple users access the same database simultaneously, SQL Server processes the query, checks for the data resources used, and then applies a lock to safeguard them. The following are the lock modes in SQL Server: 

- `Shared (S) Lock Mode:` It is used with the SELECT statement and for read-only data. It prevents making changes in data while executing the query. 
- `Update (U) Lock Mode:` It is used to modify the particular data. It prevents deadlocks when the transaction is ready to modify the U convert into the X lock. 
- `Exclusive (X) Lock Mode:` It ensures that only one transaction can update the same data at a time and is used with commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. 
- `Bulk Update (BU) Lock Mode:` Imposed when data is copied in bulk, often used with the TABLOCK hint. 
- `Intent (I) Lock Mode:` It manages the lock hierarchy and checks how the locks are coordinated at different levels. It signals the intention of the transaction and imposes the lock (S) or (X) on data. By doing so, it prevents conflicts in the transactions. It is of three types of intent intent shared (IS), intent exclusive (IX), and shared with intent exclusive (SIX) locks. 
- `Key-Range Lock Mode:` Used in serializable transaction isolation levels to prevent data anomaly, where the same query returns different results each time it runs. 
- `Schema (Sch) Lock Mode:` It is used for schema-dependent operations. Schema modification (Sch-M) lock for DDL statements (CREATE, ALTER, DROP). It prevents data access during structure modification, while schema stability (Sch-S) lock allows other locks except Sch-M during schema-dependent transactions. 

## What is the difference between a deadlock and a Livelock?
	
`Deadlock` occurs when two or more processes prevent each other from obtaining a lock.
`Livelock` occurs when multiple retries and activities cause processes to continuously adapt each with no such progress.

## What is Sharding in MySQL?

Sharding in MySQL is a technique used to distribute data across multiple servers, based on a shared key, to improve scalability and performance. Each server stores a subset of the data, and queries are routed to the appropriate server based on the shard key.

## What is difference between horizontal and vertical sharding? 

Sharding is a type of DataBase partitioning in which a large database is divided or partitioned into smaller data and different nodes. Each shard contains a subset of the data, allowing for parallel processing and distributed storage. By dividing the database into smaller, more manageable parts, sharding enables improved scalability, enhanced performance, and higher throughput.

- `Horizontal sharding` involves dividing the database horizontally, where data is distributed based on rows or entities. 
- `Vertical sharding` involves splitting the database vertically, meaning the tables or entities are divided based on columns or attributes.

Few common sharding architectures

> Key Based Sharding

`Key based sharding` can be said as hash based sharding in which a key is used to determine the shard value or id to which it belongs by plugging the key into a hash function .

> Range Based Sharding

`Range based sharding` involves sharding data based on ranges of a given value.

> Directory Based Sharding

`Directory based sharding `must create and maintain a lookup table that uses a shard key to keep track of which shard holds which data.

## What is a MySQL proxy?

A MySQL proxy is a lightweight middleware that sits between client applications and the MySQL server, providing features such as load balancing, failover, query routing, and caching.

## What is the Query Cache in MySQL and how do you enable it?

The Query Cache is a technique that caches the results of SELECT queries so that following similar queries may be delivered from the cache rather than performing them again, which can assist to improve speed, particularly for read-heavy workloads. To enable the query cache, set the `query_cache_size` variable to something other than 0.

## Write the Syntactical Flow of MySQL Query?

- `SELECT`: It starts with a list of columns or expressions. 
- `FROM`: Logically query starts from the FROM clause by assembling the initial set of data. 
- `WHERE`: It acts upon the record set assembled by the FROM clause to filter certain rows based upon conditions. 
- `GROUP BY`: It groups the larger data set into smaller data sets based on the columns specified. 
- `HAVING`: It is used to restrict the result of aggregation by GROUP BY. 
- `ORDER BY`: It determines the sort order of the result set. 

## What is Coalesce() and IsNull()?

- `Coalesce():` Returns the first non-null value passed into the param list. 
- `IsNull():` Returns the specified value if the passed expression is null; otherwise, it returns the expression. 

## How are they different from Stored Procedure and Stored Function?

`A Stored function` in MySQL is a set of SQL statements that perform some task/operation and return a single value. It is of two types i.e., built-in and user-defined.

`A Stored function` in MySQL works with SELECT, WHERE, and HAVING clauses. It can be used to store business logic and formulas in database. It does not allow to specify OUT, INOUT parameters.

`Stored Procedure` in MySQL are precompiled SQL code that is stored on the database server. They enable you to organize complex SQL queries and logic into a single unit that can be executed repeatedly without having to recompile the code each time.

`Stored Procedure` in MySQL can even run SELECT command and table manipulation commands like INSERT, UPDATE  and DELETE (DML operations). It accepts only input parameters and does not have output parameters.

## What is MySQL clustering?

MySQL clustering, also known as MySQL Cluster or MySQL NDB Cluster, is a high-availability, scalable, and distributed database architecture that ensures fault tolerance and automatic data partitioning across multiple nodes. It combines the MySQL server with the NDB (Network DataBase) storage engine and provides real-time, in-memory storage with support for disk-based data as well.

The main components of MySQL Cluster are:
- `Data Nodes (NDB storage engine):` These store the actual data in a partitioned and replicated manner, ensuring data availability and redundancy. Each data node operates in parallel, which improves performance and resilience.

- `MySQL Server Nodes (SQL Nodes):` These are conventional MySQL servers that connect to the data nodes, processing SQL queries and transactions for client applications.

- `Management Nodes:` These nodes handle the configuration and orchestration of the cluster, monitoring its health and managing node membership.

## What is normalization?

Normalization is the process of organizing a relational database's structure to reduce data redundancy, improve data integrity, and optimize its performance. The primary goal of normalization is to eliminate anomalies in the data and create a better database design by dividing large tables into smaller, related ones and defining relationships between them.

Normalization involves organizing data into multiple tables, ensuring that each table serves a single purpose and contains minimal redundant data. The process is carried out through a series of normalization forms called normal forms, including First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), Third Normal Form (3NF), Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), Fourth Normal Form (4NF), and Fifth Normal Form (5NF). 

## What is a pivot table, and how do you create one in MySQL?

A pivot table is a data processing technique used to summarize, aggregate, or reorganize data from a larger dataset in a tabular format. It allows you to transform rows into columns, typically used to display data in a more compact and easily understandable way. MySQL does not have a built-in pivot table feature, To create you can use a combination of aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, or AVG along with GROUP BY and CASE statements.

## What is profiling in MySQL and how do you use it?

MySQL profiling is a technique for tracking and analyzing query performance in order to discover sluggish queries, optimize them, and monitor overall database performance. To enable profiling, you need to set the profiling variable to a non-zero value, run your queries, and then examine the results using the SHOW PROFILES and SHOW PROFILE commands.

## How do you set up replication in MySQL?

To set up replication in MySQL, you can use the MASTER and SLAVE statements to define the master and slave servers and the replication configuration.

## How do you use the Performance Schema in MySQL?

The MySQL Performance Schema is a tool that collects and aggregates data about server events, threads, queries, and resources in order to monitor and analyze database performance. Various Performance Schema tables and views may be used to discover performance bottlenecks, optimize queries, and monitor server activity.

List different ways to perform MySQL backup.

MySQL backup offers different level of data consistency, export options, and performance. It's important to choose the backup method that best meets your needs for consistency, recovery time, and complexity. Regularly test backups to ensure reliable recovery when needed.

`mysqldump:` This command-line utility comes with MySQL and is widely used for creating logical backups. It exports the database schema and data in the form of SQL statements, which can be easily restored by executing them in the MySQL server. Example usage:
mysqldump -u username -p your_database_name > backup_file.sql

`mysqlhotcopy:` This utility is designed for backing up MyISAM and ARCHIVE tables. It uses file system-level operations to create a consistent snapshot of the tables. The main advantage is its speed, but it's limited in terms of supported storage engines and backup flexibility.

`MySQL Enterprise Backup:` This is a commercial solution provided by MySQL, offering a wide range of backup features, such as online backups, incremental backups, and partial backups. It is designed for InnoDB and offers better performance and flexibility than mysqldump or mysqlhotcopy.

`MySQL Workbench:` This graphical management tool provides a user-friendly way to create logical backups using an Export Data feature. This approach is suitable for smaller databases or less frequent backups and is more accessible for users who are not comfortable with command-line utilities.

`File System-level Backup:` This method involves manually copying the database files from the MySQL data directory to a backup location. It's essential to ensure that the server is stopped or the tables are locked to create a consistent backup. This method allows for fast restoration but involves more manual efforts.

`Replication and Cloning:` You can use MySQL replication or cloning to create a consistent backup of the database on another server. The replicated server acts as a live copy of the original server, which can be used for backup and disaster recovery purposes.

`Third-Party Tools:` Several third-party backup tools, such as Percona XtraBackup or Navicat for MySQL, offer additional features and interfaces to perform MySQL backups more efficiently or with more options.

## What is the role of InnoDB in MySQL, and how does it differ from MyISAM?

- `ACID Compliance`
`InnoDB` ACID-compliant, which means it supports transactions and ensures data integrity during operations like inserts, updates, or deletes. This makes it suitable for transactional systems and applications that require data consistency.
`MyISAM` is not ACID-compliant and does not support transactions, which makes it less suitable for applications that require high levels of data integrity and reliability.

- `Locking techniques`
`InnoDB` uses row-level locking, which allows multiple users to read and write in the same table simultaneously without generating lock conflicts, improving concurrency and performance in multi-user environments.
`MylSAM` uses table-level locking, which can cause lock contention and reduced performance when multiple users are reading and writing to the same table.

- `Foreign Key Support`
`InnoDB` supports foreign key constraints, ensuring — referential integrity between tables, which is beneficial for maintaining data consistency in relationships.
`MyISAM` does not support foreign key constraints, and developers must manually enforce referential integrity rules.

- `Crash Recovery`
`InnoDB` has a built-in crash recovery mechanism using transaction logs, making it more resilient to potential crashes and allowing for easier data restoration.
`MyISAM` lacks a built-in crash recovery mechanism, which makes it potentially less reliable in case of crashes or data corruption.

- `Efficiency and performance`
`InnoDB` uses a buffer pool to cache frequently accessed data and indexes in memory, optimizing performance for read and write operations.
`MyISAM` tables are generally more compact and consume less storage space than InnoDB tables, thanks to better compression and storage methods.

## What is the MySQL slow query log, and how do you use it?

The MySQL slow query log is a log file that captures queries that take longer than a specified amount of time to execute. This log helps database administrators identify poorly performing or inefficient queries that may be impacting the overall database performance. Monitoring and optimizing slow queries is critical for maintaining a fast and responsive database system.

To use the MySQL slow query log, follow these steps:

Enable the slow query log: You'll first need to enable and configure the slow query log in the MySQL configuration file (usually my.cnf or my.ini). Add or modify the following lines in the configuration file:
```bash
slow_query_log = ON
slow_query_log_file = /path/to/slow_query_log_file.log
long_query_time = 2
```

## Explain the concept of Common Table Expressions (CTE) in MySQL?

A CTE is a temporary result set that can be used within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. They provide a more readable and maintainable alternative to subqueries and derived tables. CTEs are defined using the `WITH` keyword, followed by a query that generates the result set. CTEs enable user to more easily write & maintain complex queries via increased readability & simplification.

```sql
WITH cte_name (column1, column2, ...) AS
(
  SELECT ...
)
SELECT ... FROM cte_name;
```

## Explain the concept of Prepared Statements in MySQL?

Prepared statements are a way of precompiling and executing SQL statements securely and efficiently, as they separate SQL code from data, reducing the risk of SQL injection.

`PREPARE stmt_name FROM preparable_stmt`
A statement template is sent to the database server. The server prepares a statement for execution.

`EXECUTE stmt_name [USING @var_name [, @var_name] …]`
The client binds parameter values and sends them to the server. 

`{DEALLOCATE | DROP} PREPARE stmt_name`
used to release the prepared statement.

## Explain the CASCADE and RESTRICT keywords ?

The CASCADE and RESTRICT keywords define how the database should handle a situation involving foreign keys when a parent record is deleted or updated:

- `CASCADE:` When the parent record is deleted or updated, the corresponding child records are automatically deleted or updated.
- `RESTRICT:` Deletion or update of the parent record is prevented if there are child records.

## Explain the ANY and ALL keywords ?

The ANY and ALL operators are used to compare a value to each value in another result set or expression.

- `ANY:` It's true if the comparison is true for any value.
- `ALL:` It's true only if the comparison is true for all values.

## What is MySQL event scheduler, and how do you create a scheduled event?

The MySQL Event Scheduler is a process that runs in the background and periodically executes stored routines like procedures, functions, or SQL statements at predefined times or intervals.

To create a scheduled event:

- Ensure that Event Scheduler is enabled: `SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;`
- To verify the status of the event_scheduler, utilize the following query: `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'event_scheduler';` or `SHOW variables WHERE variable_name ='event_scheduler'`;
- Create the event using the `CREATE EVENT` syntax:
- To check events` SHOW EVENTS;`
- For disabling or enabling specific event 
```bash
## To disable same event
mysql> alter event event_name disable;
## To enable same event
mysql> alter event event_name enable;
## To change scheduled event time from current 30 second to 1 minute:
mysql> alter event event_name on schedule every 1 minute
## To drop a specific event:
mysql> DROP EVENT IF EXISTS event_name;
```
```sql
CREATE EVENT event_name
ON SCHEDULE EVERY 10 SECOND
DO
    CALL procedure_name;
```

## Why use Prepared Statements?

- `Prevent SQL Injection:` — it helps prevent SQL injection attacks, a common security vulnerability in web applications. With prepared statements, user input is treated as data rather than a part of the SQL query, making it harder for attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
- `Performance:` — It can improve performance by reducing the load associated with parsing, planning, and optimizing SQL queries. When you use prepared statements, the server prepares the query once and catches the execution plan, allowing it to be reused with different parameter values.
- `Scalability:` — It reduces the workload on the database server, Prepared Statements can improve the scalability in a high-traffic environment.
- `Code Readability and Maintainability:` — Prepared Statements make your code more readable and maintainable by separating SQL queries from data values. This makes it easier to understand the query intent and modify it according to need.

## What is MySQL Event scheduling?

Event scheduling is a powerful feature in MySQL that allows you to automate tasks and execute them on a predefined schedule. Whether you want to perform routine maintenance, generate reports, or update data, event scheduling can streamline these processes.

Benefits of Event Scheduling:

- `Automation:` Events enable you to automate routine tasks, reducing the need for manual execution and potential errors.
- `Consistency:` By scheduling events, you ensure that specific actions are taken at regular intervals, maintaining the consistency and integrity of your data.
- `Efficiency:` Event scheduling helps optimize resource usage by allowing you to run resource-intensive operations during off-peak hours.
- `Reporting:` Regularly generated reports can be a crucial part of business operations, and events make it easier to generate and distribute these reports.

## What is MySQL Scaling?

Scaling MySQL is an essential part of ensuring that your database can handle increased traffic and data. Vertical scaling, horizontal scaling, sharding, query optimization, caching, and partitioning are all viable options that you can use to scale your MySQL database.

1. Vertical Scaling:
Vertical scaling is the process of adding more resources to your existing server to improve its performance. You can achieve this by increasing the RAM, CPU, or storage of your server. This approach is straightforward and requires minimal changes to your existing infrastructure. However, it has its limitations, and you may reach a point where adding more resources will no longer provide a noticeable improvement in performance.

2. Horizontal Scaling:
Horizontal scaling is the process of adding more servers to your infrastructure to handle increased traffic and data. This approach is more complex than vertical scaling but offers better scalability. You can use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers and replicate your data across them to ensure data consistency.

3. Sharding:
Sharding is a technique used to distribute data across multiple servers. It involves splitting your data into smaller chunks and storing them on different servers. Each server can then handle a smaller subset of data, improving performance and scalability. However, sharding requires careful planning and implementation, and you should only consider it once other scaling options have been exhausted.

4. Query Optimization
Optimizing your queries is an essential part of scaling MySQL. Slow queries can have a significant impact on the performance of your database, and optimizing them can help reduce the load on your server. You can use tools like the MySQL Slow Query Log to identify slow queries and optimize them.

5. Caching:
Caching is a technique used to improve the performance of your database by storing frequently accessed data in memory. You can use caching tools like Memcached or Redis to cache your data and reduce the load on your server. Caching can significantly improve the performance of your database, especially for read-heavy workloads.

6. Partitioning:
Partitioning is a technique used to divide large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces. It involves dividing a table into smaller partitions based on a specific column or key. Each partition can then be stored on a separate server, improving performance and scalability. Partitioning is an advanced technique that requires careful planing and implementation, and you should only consider it once other scaling options have been exhausted.
