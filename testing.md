# Understanding Different Types of API Testing:

>  `Smoke Testing:` Verifies basic functionality post-API development to ensure no immediate issues.

>  `Functional Testing:` Tests APIs against functional requirements to validate expected outcomes.

>  `Integration Testing:` Combines API calls to test end-to-end functionality and data flow.

>  `Regression Testing:` Ensures updates donâ€™t disrupt existing API functionalities.

>  `Load Testing:` Evaluates performance under varying loads to determine application capacity.

>  `Stress Testing:` Tests API resilience under high loads to ensure consistent performance.

>  `Security Testing:` Checks APIs for vulnerabilities against external threats.

>  `UI Testing:` Ensures APIs interact effectively with UI components for proper data display.

>  `Fuzz Testing:` Identifies vulnerabilities by injecting unexpected data to test API robustness.
