## Laravel Installer Update

Feature: The updated Laravel installer now ensures compatibility with the new starter kits in Laravel 12.

> Laravel 11

```bash 
laravel new my-app  # Uses Laravel 11 skeleton
```

> Laravel 12

```bash 
composer global update laravel/installer
laravel new my-app  # Installs Laravel 12 with new starter kits
```

- `Step 1:` Verify PHP Version - Ensure your server is running PHP 8.2 or higher, as Laravel 12 requires it. 

- `Step 2:` Update Laravel with Composer - `composer require laravel/framework:12.0`

- `Step 3:` Run Database Migrations - `php artisan migrate`, To preview changes - `php artisan migrate --pretend`

## Migration of Laravel 11 to 12 

1. `Enhanced Performance and Query Optimizations`

Performance improvements are a key focus in Laravel 12, especially for large applications handling complex queries.

> Laravel 11 (Previous Approach)

```php
$users = User::all(); // Loads all users into memory, inefficient for large datasets
```

> Laravel 12 (Optimized Query Handling)

```php
$users = User::query()->select(['id', 'name'])->cursor(); // More efficient memory usage 
```

With cursor(), Laravel 12 optimizes large dataset handling by fetching records in smaller chunks, reducing memory consumption.

2. `Improved Eloquent Lazy and Eager Loading`

Eloquent in Laravel 12 now handles relationships more efficiently, reducing N+1 query problems and improving execution speed.

> Laravel 11 (Potential N+1 Query Issue)

```php
$users = User::all();
foreach ($users as $user) {
    echo $user->posts->count(); // Triggers multiple queries
}
```

> Laravel 12 (Optimized Eager Loading)

```php
$users = User::withCount('posts')->get(); // Fetches posts count in a single query
```
By using withCount(), Laravel 12 minimizes database queries, enhancing performance.

3. `Asynchronous Caching for Real-Time Performance`

No more waiting on slow cache operations. Laravel 12 introduces an asynchronous caching method that runs in the background, providing a more responsive experience.

> Laravel 11

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;
$user = Cache::remember("user_{$id}", 600, function() use ($id) {
    return User::find($id);
});
```

> Laravel 12

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;
$user = Cache::rememberAsync("user_{$id}", 600, function() use ($id) {
    return User::find($id);
});
```

4. `Streamlined Dependency Injection with PHP 8 Features`

Laravel 12 fully embraces constructor property promotion, reducing boilerplate code and making controllers cleaner.

> Laravel 11

```php
class OrderController
{
    protected $orderService;
    public function __construct(OrderService $orderService)
    {
        $this->orderService = $orderService;
    }
}
```

> Laravel 12

```php
class OrderController
{
    public function __construct(private OrderService $orderService) {}
}
```

5. `Enhanced API Development and Routing Optimizations`

Building robust APIs is easier than ever with native GraphQL support and a cleaner API versioning system. Additionally, Laravel 12 brings performance optimizations behind the scenes â€” improving routing internals and reducing execution time without changing your existing route definitions.

> Laravel 11

```php
Route::get('/api/v1/products', [ProductController::class, 'index']);
```

> Laravel 12

```php
Route::apiVersion(1)->group(function () {
    Route::get('/products', [ProductController::class, 'index']);
});
```

6. `Next-Generation Eloquent ORM Features`

The Eloquent ORM now supports conditional eager loading and more flexible relationship constraints, enabling you to build complex queries with less code.

> Laravel 11

```php
$orders = Order::with(['items' => function($query) {
    $query->where('status', 'shipped');
}])->get();
```

> Laravel 12

```php
$orders = Order::withFiltered('items', ['status' => 'shipped'])->get();
```

7. `Optimized Queue & Job Handling`

With dynamic job prioritization and advanced retry strategies, Laravel 12 ensures that your critical tasks are processed first.

> Laravel 11

```php
dispatch(new ProcessPayment($payment))->onQueue('high');
```

> Laravel 12

```php
dispatch(new ProcessPayment($payment))->setPriority('high');
```

## Additional Enhancements & Breaking Changes

8. `WorkOS AuthKit Integration`

Feature: Integrates WorkOS AuthKit for SSO, social login, and passkeys in starter kits, offering an alternative to traditional authentication.

> Laravel 11

```php
// routes/web.php
use Laravel\Socialite\Facades\Socialite;
Route::get('/auth/redirect', fn() => Socialite::driver('github')->redirect());
Route::get('/auth/callback', fn() => Auth::login(Socialite::driver('github')->user()));
```

> Laravel 12

```php
// routes/web.php (with WorkOS AuthKit enabled)
use WorkOS\Laravel\AuthKit;
Route::get('/auth/workos', [AuthKit::class, 'redirect']);
Route::get('/auth/workos/callback', [AuthKit::class, 'handleCallback']);
Configuration adjustments in config/auth.php may be required:

'workos' => [
    'client_id' => env('WORKOS_CLIENT_ID'),
    'client_secret' => env('WORKOS_CLIENT_SECRET'),
    'redirect' => '/auth/workos/callback',
],
```
9. `Updated Dependencies (Carbon 3.x)`

Feature: Laravel 12 now requires Carbon 3.x, dropping support for Carbon 2.x, with minor API adjustments.

> Laravel 11

```json 
// composer.json
"require": {
    "laravel/framework": "^11.0",
    "nesbot/carbon": "^2.0"
}
```

> Laravel 12

```json 
// composer.json
"require": {
    "laravel/framework": "^12.0",
    "nesbot/carbon": "^3.0"
}
```

```php
use Carbon\Carbon;
$date = Carbon::parse('2024-01-01')->plusDays(10); // Carbon 3.x preferred syntax
```

10. `Schema::getTableListing Enhancement`

Feature: `Schema::getTableListing()` now returns schema-qualified table names by default.

> Laravel 11

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;
$tables = Schema::getTableListing(); // ['users', 'posts']
```

> Laravel 12

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;
$tables = Schema::getTableListing(); // ['main.users', 'main.posts']
$tables = Schema::getTableListing(schemaQualified: false); // ['users', 'posts']
```

11. `Concurrency::run with Associative Arrays`

Feature: When using associative arrays, the keys are preserved in the results.

> Laravel 11

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Concurrency;
$result = Concurrency::run([
    'task1' => fn() => 1 + 1,
    'task2' => fn() => 2 + 2,
]); // [2, 4]
```

> Laravel 12

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Concurrency;
$result = Concurrency::run([
    'task1' => fn() => 1 + 1,
    'task2' => fn() => 2 + 2,
]); // ['task1' => 2, 'task2' => 4]
```

12. `mergeIfMissing with Dot Notation`

Feature: Dot notation now expands into nested arrays, enabling cleaner data merging.

> Laravel 11

```php
$request->mergeIfMissing(['user.name' => 'John']); // ['user.name' => 'John']
```

> Laravel 12

```php
$request->mergeIfMissing(['user.name' => 'John']); // ['user' => ['name' => 'John']]
```

13. `Image Validation Rule Change`

Feature: SVG images are no longer allowed by default in the image validation rule, enhancing security and consistency.

> Laravel 11

```php
$request->validate(['avatar' => 'image']); // Allowed PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.
```

> Laravel 12

```php
$request->validate(['avatar' => 'image|mimes:png,jpg']); // SVG blocked
$request->validate(['avatar' => 'image|mimes:svg']);   // Explicitly allow SVG
```
