### What is Symfony?

```
Symfony is a PHP framework that aims to accelerate the design and maintenance of web applications and replace recurrent coding tasks. A few prerequisites are mandate for installation: Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS or Microsoft Windows, and a web server with PHP. 

Rails-like programming method, clean design, and code readability. Symfony offers Ajax helpers, plugins, and an admin generator interface, which renders the programming of complete applications truly easy. The developers hence can concentrate on applicative logic without wasting time writing infinite XML configuration files. 

Symfony can be utilized to create powerful applications in an enterprise context as it permits developers to test, debug, and document projects, giving them complete control over configuration and customization - from the directory structure to the foreign libraries. Symfony utilizes the Model-View-Controller design pattern, splitting the business logic from the presentation layer. 
```
### What are the benefits of Symfony?

> Symfony PHP framework is effortless to use gratitude to its Ruby-On-As a development framework. Symfony simplifies a developer's work, as it doesn't require writing extensive codes to create web applications.

### Advantages of Symfony Framework: 

- `Fast-Paced Development:` Time requires fast and high-performance applications. The developer community needs the flexibility to create great applications. Symfony 2 has the ability for performance optimization of applications. It ingests less memory and authorizes developers to develop applications at a considerable speed. 
- `Flexibility:` Symfony is fully adjustable to a developer's unique requirements, with independent and configurable components. Developers can easily create complicated applications with multiple functional features with their event dispatcher and dependency injector. The required functionalities can be built brick by brick and carry out the development task at their own pace. 
- `Expandable Framework:` Everything is present as a bundle in Symfony. Each bundle adds unique functionality and adds to its expansion. A developer reuses a bundle in another project and shares it with the community. Bundles can be reused to change everything within Symfony without the necessity to reconfigure the complete framework. It allows changing the core itself to help expand the framework. 
- `Stable Framework:` The company's developers offer support for three years, although they can provide you lifetime support on security-related issues. The company plans to furnish more stability by assuring compatibility among its minor versions. This guarantees the stability and sustainability of the application developed in any version of the framework. Moreover, it can also deliver compatibility with the public APIs for more functional advantages. 
- `Comfort & Convenience:` The Framework delivers a highly functional development environment and conveys to developers the desired level of pleasure and ease. Instead of concentrating on minor functionalities, the framework facilitates developers to focus more on the core functional features of an application. This improves a developer's productivity and makes their task smooth and error-free. Symfony devices, such as the Web Debug Toolbar, bring more convenience for a developer to address errors and security-related issues. 
- `User Friendly:` Symfony is an easy-to-use framework for any developer and is highly convenient for beginners and advanced users, with a host of documentation and support from the company and the community. With an acceptable level of professional support, a newbie can quickly learn the best practices of Symfony Development to help create agile and performance-driven solutions. 

###  What are the components in Symfony?

Symfony Components are a collection of decoupled and reusable PHP libraries. It is open-source software that desires to quicken or speed up the creation and maintenance of web applications, substitute repetitive coding tasks, create powerful and robust applications in an enterprise context, and give developers complete control over the configuration. 

Symfony Components are decoupled libraries for PHP applications. Symfony provides components ranging from the simple feature, say file system, to advanced features, events, container, and dependency injection.

Refer to the following example:

public function sessionAction(SessionInterface $session)  
{  
    // to set an attribute
    $session->set('user_id,' 10);  
   // to get the attribute that a controller already sets
    $user_id = $session->get('user_id');    
}

Introduction
SOLID is an acronym that represents five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and have become fundamental guidelines for object-oriented design. This repository serves as a practical guide to implementing SOLID principles in PHP with real-world examples.

SOLID Principles
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have only one responsibility.

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The OCP suggests that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you can add new functionality without altering existing code.

Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
The LSP states that objects of a superclass should be able to replace objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The ISP recommends that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. It promotes the creation of smaller, more specific interfaces.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
The DIP emphasizes that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. It also introduces the concept that abstractions should not depend on details, but details should depend on abstractions.

What is auto wiring, it is “Defining Services Dependencies Automatically” as stated on the symfony page. Before auto wiring symfony had a need to manually configure all you classes in service definitions. Those would be in yaml, xml and php files.
config/services.yaml

Value Resolvers:

Symfony Value Resolvers are a mechanism that allows, for example, to obtain as arguments of an action:

services registered in the application container
session object or logged in user
request or a single request attribute


Design patterns are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming, providing a blueprint for solving recurring problems in a structured and maintainable way.

the Factory Method design pattern is a powerful tool for creating objects while allowing subclasses to determine the exact type of objects to be created.


Session management is handled by Symfony HttpFoundation component, that has a very powerful and flexible session subsystem which is designed to provide session management through a simple object-oriented interface using a variety of session storage drivers.

Typically, by default, it will save to file in directory /var/cache/sessions/


#Session Attributes
Session attributes are stored in a bag, and acts like an array.

set() : Sets an attribute by key.
get() : Gets an attribute by key.
all() : Gets all attributes as an array of key => value.
has() : Returns true if the attribute exists.
replace() : Sets multiple attributes at once: takes a keyed array and sets each key => value pair.
remove() : Deletes an attribute by key.
clear() : Clear all attributes.
#Bag Management
registerBag() : Registers a SessionBagInterface.
getBag() : Gets a SessionBagInterface by bag name.
getFlashBag() : Gets the FlashBagInterface. This is just a shortcut for convenience.
#Basic Example
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Session\Session;

Source code

<?php $session = new Session(); $session->start(); // setting and getting sessions $session->set('username', 'digvijaytiwari'); $session->get('name'); ?>
