## What is a Service Provider in Laravel?
A Service Provider is a class responsible for registering services in the container. The `AppServiceProvider` class for instance.

All service providers extend the `Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider` class. Most service providers contain a register and a boot method. Within the register method, you should only bind things into the service container. You should never attempt to register any event listeners, routes, or any other piece of functionality within the register method.

## What is Laravel Controllers?
A Laravel controller reresents the C part in the MVC architecture which is reponsible for orchistering the operations between the View and Model and passing information from the model to the view for rendering it.

## What is Laravel Views?
A Laravel view represents the V part of the MVC architecture. They are simply HTML pages (with CSS and JavaScript) composing the UI of the application that are sent to the client once they are processed and rendered. Views are merely presentationel i.e they don't contain business logic .

## What is Laravel Models and Migrations?
In Laravel, the Model from the MVC pattern represents the part that contains the business/domain logic. It corresponds to a table in the database and allow you to interact with the database with high level APIs.

Migrations allow you to create the intial database tables and their fields and then track any changes made to the database schema during the development or even in production and apply them without the need of dropping and recreating the database each time.

## What is Laravel Middlewares?
Laravel middleware is a mechanism that filters HTTP requests entering your application. Laravel includes several builtin middlewares for authentication and CSRF protection but you can also create your custom middlewares.

It sits between the request and the application's core, allowing you to intercept, modify, or reject requests based on certain conditions. Middleware can be used for tasks like authentication, logging, and request manipulation. It provides a flexible way to handle cross-cutting concerns in your application's HTTP lifecycle, ensuring clean and modular code organization.

## What is Laravel Eloquent ORM?
Laravel makes use of an ORM which stands for Object Relationnal Mapper and implements the PHP Active Record Pattern. This allows you to work with databases without actually dealing with SQL and the differences between database systems. The Laravel ORM is called Eloquent ORM.

## What is Laravel Routing?
Routing is an important feature in any web application and allows your app to route HTTP requests to the appropriate handler which sends an appropriate response be it an HTML view or a JSON response.
You can create routes in the routes folder of your project in one of the avaiabe files:
- **api.php:** API Routes
- **channels.php:** Broadcast Channels
- **console.php:** Console Routes
- **web.php:** Web routes

## What is Laravel Reverb?
Laravel Reverb is a WebSocket server that delivers fast and scalable real-time communication directly to your Laravel application. Importantly, Reverb provides seamless integration with Laravel's existing event broadcasting tools, especially with PresenceChannel, giving the ability to track present users, which is revolutionary for applications requiring such real-time data.

## What is Laravel Blade?
Laravel Blade is the default templating engine for the Laravel framework. It allows you to write HTML code with embedded PHP expressions, variables, loops, conditional statements, and other features. Blade files have the .blade.php extension and are stored in the resources/views directory of your Laravel project.

Blade views are compiled into plain PHP code and cached until modified, making them fast and efficient. Blade also provides several directives and helpers that make your code more readable and expressive.

## What is Laravel Request and Responses?
Traditionnal frameworks like Laravel works based on HTTP request and response cycles. Requests are sent from clients using HTTP verbs like GET, POST, DELETE and UPDATE. When they are processed by Laravel, appropriate responses are created and sent back to clients. A response is created and sent from the controller mapped to the route which received the request.

## What is SQLite in Laravel?
Laravel uses SQLite for database storage along with that database driver for Laravel's session, cache, and queue.

## What is Laravel Traits?
- Traits can be included in classes to give them additional methods and functionality.
- Traits offer several advantages, including code reusability, flexibility in composition, and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Traits can help you to organize your code, promote code reuse, simplify code maintenance, and facilitate code sharing within a team.

## What is Laravel Facade?
A Facade is a name given to a type of class in the Laravel framework that enables beginner-friendly and/or aesthetically pleasing access to tools and services held within the framework's IoC container.

Injection through the constructor also gives additional clarity to the dependencies of the class, that is much easier to observe than scanning the class source for Facade usages.

## Securing Your Laravel Application:
- Keep Your Laravel Framework Updated
> Example: 
- Use Composer to update your Laravel framework: composer update.
- Use Strong Authentication Mechanisms
> Example: 
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication scaffolding and consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
- Implement Proper Authorization
> Example: 
- Utilize Gates and Policies in Laravel to enforce authorization rules across your application.
- Protect Against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
> Example: 
- Use the {{ }} syntax for escaping output in Blade templates, and e() helper function for escaping strings.
- Prevent SQL Injection
> Example: 
- Always use Eloquent ORM or Laravel's query builder to construct SQL queries instead of raw SQL queries.
- Secure Sensitive Data
> Example: 
- Use Laravel's encrypt and decrypt methods to handle sensitive data, and store encryption keys securely in the .env file.
- Enable HTTPS
> Example: 
- Use Laravel's url()->secure() function to generate secure URLs and configure your web server (like Nginx or Apache) to force HTTPS.
- Monitor and Log Activities
> Example: 
- Use Laravel's built-in logging system and consider integrating with external monitoring tools like Sentry or New Relic for advanced monitoring
