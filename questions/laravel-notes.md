## What is a Service Provider in Laravel?
A Service Provider is a class responsible for registering services in the container. The AppServiceProvider class for instance.

## What is Laravel Container?
The container, in simple terms, is like a magic box in which you store your services that can retrieve and conveniently serve you whatever you need.

## What is Laravel Reverb?
Laravel Reverb is a WebSocket server that delivers fast and scalable real-time communication directly to your Laravel application. Importantly, Reverb provides seamless integration with Laravel’s existing event broadcasting tools, especially with PresenceChannel, giving the ability to track present users, which is revolutionary for applications requiring such real-time data.

## What is Laravel Blade?
Laravel Blade is the default templating engine for the Laravel framework. It allows you to write HTML code with embedded PHP expressions, variables, loops, conditional statements, and other features. Blade files have the .blade.php extension and are stored in the resources/views directory of your Laravel project.

Blade views are compiled into plain PHP code and cached until modified, making them fast and efficient. Blade also provides several directives and helpers that make your code more readable and expressive.

## What is Laravel Request and Responses ?
Traditionnal frameworks like Laravel works based on HTTP request and response cycles. Requests are sent from clients using HTTP verbs like GET, POST, DELETE and UPDATE. When they are processed by Laravel, appropriate responses are created and sent back to clients. A response is created and sent from the controller mapped to the route which received the request.

## What is SQLite in Laravel ?
The new Laravel version uses SQLite for database storage along with that database driver for Laravel’s session, cache, and queue.

## What is Laravel Traits?
Traits are a way to reuse code in Laravel.
They are similar to classes, but they cannot be instantiated on their own.
Traits can be included in classes to give them additional methods and functionality.
Traits offer several advantages, including code reusability, flexibility in composition, and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle.
Using traits can help you to organize your code, promote code reuse, simplify code maintenance, and facilitate code sharing within a team.

## Securing Your Laravel Application:
- Keep Your Laravel Framework Updated
> Example: 
- Use Composer to update your Laravel framework: composer update.
- Use Strong Authentication Mechanisms
> Example: 
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication scaffolding and consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
- Implement Proper Authorization
> Example: 
- Utilize Gates and Policies in Laravel to enforce authorization rules across your application.
- Protect Against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
> Example: 
- Use the {{ }} syntax for escaping output in Blade templates, and e() helper function for escaping strings.
- Prevent SQL Injection
> Example: 
- Always use Eloquent ORM or Laravel's query builder to construct SQL queries instead of raw SQL queries.
- Secure Sensitive Data
> Example: 
- Use Laravel's encrypt and decrypt methods to handle sensitive data, and store encryption keys securely in the .env file.
- Enable HTTPS
> Example: 
- Use Laravel's url()->secure() function to generate secure URLs and configure your web server (like Nginx or Apache) to force HTTPS.
- Monitor and Log Activities
> Example: 
- Use Laravel's built-in logging system and consider integrating with external monitoring tools like Sentry or New Relic for advanced monitoring
