- `Gates:` Gates are used to define and check authorization policies for specific actions or operations in your application.
- `Policies:` Policies are used to define authorization policies for specific models, making it easier to manage rules for CRUD operations related to those models.

### Q27. Why use Laravel Eloquent instead of the DB facade:
Laravel Eloquent ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a powerful and elegant ActiveRecord implementation for working with databases. It acts as a bridge between your applications and the underlying relational database. Eloquent makes it easy to interact with your database using objects, making interactions more intuitive and efficient.

Eloquent is a good solution for processing a single entity in CRUD manner â€” that is, create a new entity with filled properties and then save it to a database, load a record from a database, or delete.

- You can write code that is object-oriented.
- It is easier to use than writing raw SQL or using the DB facade.
- There is no binding to the table schema, just change the table name in the Eloquent model.
- Relationships between tables can be maintained in an elegant way. Just mention the type of relationship (JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN etc.) to get data from related tables.
- Eloquent queries are more readable than raw SQL or the DB facade.
- You can use methods, scopes, accessors, modifiers etc. inside of a model, which is a maintainable pattern.

### Q28. What is Query Builder ?
Laravel's Query Builder is a powerful and flexible tool for interacting with your database, which provides a convenient, fluent interface for creating and running database queries.

### Q30. What is Laravel Breeze ?
Laravel Breeze is a minimal, simple implementation of all of Laravel's authentication features, including login, registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation and profile. 

### Q31. What is the principal diferences between Doctrine and Eloquent?
`Data Source Architectural Patterns :` Active Record, Data Mapper

Eloquent makes use of the Active Record, where the Model will be the representation of the database and also through it the operations in the database will be made.

Doctrine makes use of it depends on an Entity Manager â€” to be able to perform the actions in the database and the entities are representations of the database tables.

- `Active Record`
An object that wraps a row in a database table or view, encapsulates the database access, and adds domain logic on that data.

- `Data Mapper`
A layer of mappers that moves data between objects and a database while keeping them independent of each other and the mapper itself.

### Q32. Explain Events in laravel ?
An event is an action or occurrence recognized by a program that may be handled by the program or code. Laravel events provides a simple observer implementation, that allowing you to subscribe and listen for various events/actions that occur in your application.

All Event classes are generally stored in the `app/Events` directory, while their listeners are stored in `app/Listeners` of your application.

### Q33. Explain validations in laravel?
Laravel provides several different ways to validate your application incoming data. By default Laravel's base controller class uses a `ValidatesRequests trait` which provides a convenient method to validate all incoming HTTP requests coming from client.You can also validate data in laravel by creating Form Request.
```php
$validatedData = $request->validate([
    'name' => 'required|max:255',
    'username' => 'required|alpha_num',

    //
})->name('profile');
```
You can specify route names for controller actions:

> Route::get('user/profile', 'UserController@showProfile')->name('profile');

Once you have assigned a name to your routes, you may use the route's name when generating URLs or redirects via the global route function:
```php
// Generating URLs...
$url = route('profile');
// Generating Redirects...
return redirect()->route('profile');
```

### Q40. Explain Facades in Laravel ?
Laravel Facades provides a static like an interface to classes that are available in the application's service '. Laravel self-ships with many facades which provide access to almost all features of Laravel's. Laravel facades serve as "static proxies" to underlying classes in the service ' and provide benefits of a terse, expressive syntax while maintaining more testability and flexibility than traditional static methods of classes. All of Laravel's facades are defined in the `Illuminate\Support\Facades` namespace. You can easily access a facade like so:
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;

Route::get('/cache', function () {
    return Cache::get('key');
});
```

### Q41. What are Laravel eloquent ORM?
Laravel's Eloquent ORM is simple Active Record implementation for working with your database. Laravel provide many different ways to interact with your database, Eloquent is most notable of them. Each database table has a corresponding "Model" which is used to interact with that table. Models allow you to query for data in your tables, as well as insert new records into the table.
```php
// Querying or finding records from products table where tag is 'new'
$products= Product::where('tag','new');
// Inserting new record 
$product =new Product;
$product->title="Iphone 7";
$product->price="$700";
$product->tag='iphone';
$product->save();
```

You can get array of the executed queries by using getQueryLog method: `DB::getQueryLog();`

### Q43. What is reverse routing in Laravel?
Laravel reverse routing is generating URL's based on route declarations. Reverse routing makes your application so much more flexible. It defines a relationship between links and Laravel routes. When a link is created by using names of existing routes, appropriate Uri's are created automatically by Laravel. Here is an example of reverse routing.
`Route::get('login', 'users@login');`

Using reverse routing we can create a link to it and pass in any parameters that we have defined. Optional parameters, if not supplied, are removed from the generated link.

`{{ HTML::link_to_action('users@login') }}`
It will automatically generate an Url like http://xyz.com/login in view.

### Q44. How to turn off CRSF protection for specific route in Laravel?
To turn off CRSF protection in Laravel add following codes in `app/Http/Middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php`
```php
//add an array of Routes to skip CSRF check
private $exceptUrls = ['controller/route1', 'controller/route2'];
//modify this function
public function handle($request, Closure $next) {
    //add this condition 
    foreach($this->exceptUrls as $route) {
        if ($request->is($route)) return $next($request);
    }
    return parent::handle($request, $next);
}
```

### Q45. What are traits in Laravel?
PHP Traits are simply a group of methods that you want include within another class. A Trait, like an abstract class cannot be instantiated by itself. Trait are created to reduce the limitations of single inheritance in PHP by enabling a developer to reuse sets of methods freely in several independent classes living in different class hierarchies.

Here is an example of trait.
```php
trait Sharable {
public function share($item)
{
return 'share this item';
}
}
```
You could then include this Trait within other classes like this:
```php
class Post {
use Sharable;
}

class Comment {
use Sharable;
}
```
Now if you were to create new objects out of these classes you would find that they both have the share() method available:
```php
$post = new Post;
echo $post->share(''); // 'share this item' 
 
$comment = new Comment;
echo $comment->share(''); // 'share this item'
```

### Q47. Explain Laravel's Middleware?
As the name suggests, Middleware acts as a middleman between request and response. It is a type of filtering mechanism. For example, Laravel includes a middleware that verifies whether the user of the application is authenticated or not. If the user is authenticated, he will be redirected to the home page otherwise, he will be redirected to the login page.

There are two types of Middleware in Laravel.
`Global Middleware:` will run on every HTTP request of the application.
`Route Middleware:` will be assigned to a specific route.

//do some stuff
}
```
### Q55. What is the use of dd() in Laravel?
In Laravel, dd() is a helper function used to dump a variable's contents to the browser and stop the further script execution. It stands for Dump and Die.

// Retrieve data from the session:
$request->session()->get('key');
```
### Q67. What are the available route methods in Laravel?

Routes help us to land on any HTTP verb and also help us to communicate with any kind of controller or model. In Laravel, we can find common routes in `routes/web.php` file

Sometimes we need to define routes that respond to multiple HTTP verbs then we can use match method.
```php
Route::get($uri, $callback);
