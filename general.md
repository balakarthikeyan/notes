## How do you configure and handle security in transmitting data in application:
- Data transmission security is ensured through configuration and handling of encryption, authentication, and secure protocols.
- Implement encryption algorithms like SSL/TLS to secure data transmission.
- Use secure protocols like HTTPS, SFTP, or SSH for transmitting sensitive data.
- Implement authentication mechanisms like OAuth, JWT, or certificates to verify the identity of the sender and receiver.
- Apply data integrity checks like digital signatures or checksums to detect tampering.
- Implement firewall rules and network segmentation to protect against unauthorized access.
- Regularly update and patch software and libraries to address security vulnerabilities.

## Caching in enterprise application:
- Caching is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in memory for faster access.
- Caching can improve application performance by reducing the number of requests to the database or other external systems.
- Caching can be implemented at different levels such as application level, database level, and network level.
- Caching strategies include time-based expiration, least recently used (LRU) eviction, and invalidation. Examples of caching technologies include Redis, Memcached.

## Explain RabbitMQ, Service Worker on browser:
- RabbitMQ is a message broker that enables communication between distributed systems. 
- Service Worker is a browser API that allows background processing.
- RabbitMQ is used for asynchronous messaging between applications and services. It supports multiple messaging protocols such as AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), and STOMP (Simple (or Streaming) Text Orientated Messaging Protocol).
- Service Worker allows web applications to run scripts in the background, even when the browser is closed. It can be used for tasks such as caching, push notifications, and background synchronization

## What is Event-Driven Architecture?
Event-driven architecture is defined as a software design pattern in which decoupled applications can asynchronously publish and subscribe to events via an event broker (modern messaging-oriented-middleware).

Event-driven architecture is a way of building enterprise IT systems that lets information flow between applications, microservices, and connected devices in a real-time manner as events occur throughout the business.

## The fundamentals of web proxy caching with Varnish
Varnish is a caching HTTP reverse proxy. It receives requests from clients and tries to answer them from the cache. If Varnish cannot answer the request from the cache it will forward the request to the backend, fetch the response, store it in the cache and deliver it to the client.

Varnish decides whether it can store the content or not based on the response it gets back from the backend. The backend can instruct Varnish to cache the content with the HTTP response header Cache-Control. There are a few conditions where Varnish will not cache, the most common one being the use of cookies. Since cookies indicates a client-specific web object, Varnish will by default not cache it.

This behaviour as most of Varnish functionality can be changed using policies written in the Varnish Configuration Language (VCL). 

## What is FastCGI Cache
FastCGI Cache is a module of Nginx, a popular web server and reverse proxy. This module allows Nginx to cache the responses from FastCGI processes, such as those produced by a PHP application.

The cache is used to save the results of frequent or complex requests, so that the responses to future identical requests can be served more quickly, without the need to fully reprocess them.

## Monolithic Architecture
A monolithic application is a single, unified unit where all software components are interdependent. This makes it easier to build upon and debug, and it's a good choice for smaller teams or organizations with centralized decision-making. 
However, it can be restrictive and time-consuming to modify, as changes to the code base can impact large areas. 

## Microservices Architecture
A microservices architecture is made up of smaller, independent services that communicate with each other through a defined interface. This makes it easier to update, modify, deploy, or scale each service individually. Microservices are a good choice for larger, distributed teams that want decentralized decision-making.
